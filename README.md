# Speech-Recognition-Model
Speech Recognition Model is being done using Hugging face  library which automatically recognizes the speech recognition of Model.utomatic speech recognition (ASR) converts a speech signal to text, mapping a sequence of audio inputs to text outputs. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use ASR models to help users everyday, and there are many other useful user-facing applications like live captioning and note-taking during meetings.
The dataset is being taken from the Hugging face open source community and then  data is handled  and then fintuned by hugging face.
